Python - Machine Learning Models

In this research, I developed machine learning algorithms for location estimation in a
multipath cellular channel through TOA (Time of Ariival) estimation. Further, I have compared and contrasted
my results with respect to Nokia's benchmark.
One of the key achievements of my work is a novel triangulation model to predict
location coordinates using the TOAs. The model is a multi-layer perceptron and is
trained using simulated coordinates. The location estimation error in this model is less
than 1 meter with a 90% condence interval. 

Further, this model is combined with different time of arrival estimation models to predict the transmitter location using the
cross-correlated signals.
